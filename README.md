# tf-flux practice 

Hi how are you? Listen, help! I took a job on Upwork: terraform code for Flux on GKE. 
I really need your help - I don't have time to do it. I looked for modules, 
there is a native provider fluxcd/flux - should work. Can you put it all together, test it and send it to the customer? 
They give $350 fixed. Say what's wrong with me and what's with time. I will be very grateful!
